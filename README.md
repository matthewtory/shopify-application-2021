# Shopify Challenge

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my challenge submission.

https://shopify-application-2021.web.app/

## The App

I have created a photograph marketplace called **Picca**!

**Instructions**
1. Browse listings - You can purchase photographs posted by other users. Press 'Browse' on the navigation bar and pick some photos. You can click on photographs to view more details or purchase them.
2. Create a listing - You can sell your own photographs too! Navigate to the 'Sell' page, and press 'Create Listing'. Fill out the information of your photo
   * People love art because it is scarce! Usually there only exists one painting, or several prints that are part of a run
   * Picca attempts to emulate this by allowing sellers to only offer a certain number of photos for sale as part of a virtual *run*
   * Notice the fancy watermark to protect your property!
3. View purchases - To view your purchases, click the profile icon in the top right corner
